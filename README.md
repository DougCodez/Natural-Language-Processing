# What Is This Repo?
I am learning about the basics and concepts of national language processing and I am using Google Colab to document all my code and notes. All work that reflects off of national language processing I will be uploading it here

## Chapter 1 (NLP Basics)
In chapter 1 I review the basics of word vectors, stemming/lemmatization, stop words, and various techniques out there.

The modules I use throughout chapter 1 are:
 - spacy 
 - nltk
 - textblob
 - sklearn
 - regex

For the machine learning concept I use a SVM for my model to classify the data I feed it. The model in the end comes out to be 70% accurate when it goes to certify if the dummyX matches the trainingY categories layed out.
